# Presentations

- During weeks 6-10, every student presents one recent technical article on related topics
- Grading based on critical review of the paper and a 30min presentation + 10 min discussion

Example Articles:
- Hindsight Experience Replay (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495)
- IMPALA (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01561)
- Reinforcement Learning with Intrinsic Rewards (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894)
- Prioritized Replay (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
- World Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122)
- Reinforcement Learning with Expert Instruction (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00590)
- Any Neural Network + RL article, for examplt that extend DQN, A3C, PPO

Let me know your choice by Feb 8!
